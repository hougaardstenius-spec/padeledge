# 🎾 Padeledge (Beta)

PadelPulse is an early-stage AI-powered app that helps players analyze padel strokes and track their performance using video uploads.

## 🚀 How it works
1. Upload a short video of your padel practice or match.
2. The system analyzes and classifies strokes like:
   - Forehand / Backhand Groundstrokes
   - Volleys
   - Overheads (Bandeja, Vibora, Rulo, Smash)
   - Bajadas

3. View a quick summary of stroke counts and patterns.

## 🧠 Status
Currently in **beta testing phase** — using mock data for demonstration.  
Next steps:
- Integrate OpenCV for video segmentation
- Add TensorFlow or PyTorch model for stroke recognition
- Implement user accounts and dashboards

## 💡 Tech stack
- Python
- Streamlit
- OpenCV
- NumPy / Pandas
